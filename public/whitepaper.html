            <p><strong>Version 1.0 - August 2025</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <h3>0. Abstract</h3>
            <p>Cipher is a skill-based color puzzle game aiming to pioneer a new era in the world of blockchain-based gaming. It combines the engagement of traditional games with the competitive and community-driven spirit of cryptocurrency ecosystems. Players use their memory skills to compete on a global stage, both individually and for their countries, while becoming part of a sustainable digital economy centered around the $CIPHER token. Our mission is to build the world's largest and most engaging skill-based competitive gaming platform.</p>

            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <h4>1.1. The Problem</h4>
            <p>The current crypto gaming (GameFi) market is often saturated with projects where financial speculation overshadows the gameplay experience. Many games struggle to maintain player engagement and long-term interest by overly focusing on "Play-to-Earn" mechanics rather than providing sustainable entertainment. There is a noticeable lack of platforms that reward genuine skill, challenge cognitive abilities, and offer a global competitive environment.</p>
            <h4>1.2. The Solution: Cipher</h4>
            <p>Cipher is designed to fill this gap. It offers a simple yet challenging game mechanic: players are shown a colored mosaic for a short period, which they must commit to memory and then accurately recreate on a blank grid. This mechanic is as deep as it is simple, presenting a challenge for players of all skill levels.</p>
            <p>Cipher is not just a game; it's an ecosystem. It encourages players to contribute not only to their individual success but also to their country's global ranking. This fosters healthy competition and strengthens community bonds.</p>
            <h4>1.3. Vision & Mission</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Our Vision:</strong> To become the world's leading digital gaming arena where cognitive skills and strategic thinking are rewarded.</li>
                <li><strong>Our Mission:</strong> To provide players with a fair and transparent platform where they can compete globally, interact socially, and create and share value through the $CIPHER token economy.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h3>2. Game Mechanics & Gameplay</h3>
            <p>Cipher's gameplay consists of two main phases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Memory Phase:</strong> The player is shown a randomly generated color pattern on a grid of a specific size (e.g., 5x5). The player has a limited time to memorize this pattern.</li>
                <li><strong>The Matching Phase:</strong> When the time is up, the colors on the grid disappear, and the player is asked to recreate the original pattern using a color palette.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>2.1. Scoring System</h4>
            <p>The score is calculated based on three main factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The percentage of correctly placed colors that match the original pattern.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> The total time spent in both the memory and matching phases. Faster completion results in a lower time penalty.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> As the grid size increases (difficulty increases), the potential base score also increases.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.2. Player Progression & Levels</h4>
            <p>Cipher offers a progression system to keep players engaged long-term. Players level up for every 30 games they play. These levels are visually represented on player profiles with special frames and badges, indicating the player's experience and commitment to the platform.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>3. The Cipher Ecosystem: Competition, Identity, and Community</h3>
            <p>Cipher is more than just a game; it is a vibrant digital world where players interact, compete, and grow. Our ecosystem is built on three fundamental pillars:</p>
            <h4>3.1. The Arena of Competition</h4>
            <p>Competition lies at the heart of Cipher. We have designed a multi-layered competitive environment to motivate players and provide a constant goal:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Individual Glory:</strong> Players strive to climb the individual leaderboard by improving their personal best scores. This highlights personal mastery and memory skills. Playing for the top means being recognized as the most talented player on the platform.</li>
                <li><strong>National Pride:</strong> Each player's score also contributes to their country's overall ranking. The country leaderboard creates an international e-sports atmosphere, encouraging players to be part of their national team. This mechanism gives players a purpose beyond individual achievement and strengthens community bonds.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3.2. Your Digital Identity: Player Profiles</h4>
            <p>Each player's profile is their digital passport in the Cipher universe. It is not just a collection of statistics, but a reflection of the player's journey and success:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visual Progression:</strong> As players level up, the frames around their profile avatars become more ornate and distinct. This is a visual status symbol that shows a player's experience and dedication at a glance.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Players can further personalize their identity by uploading their own avatars. The profile showcases the player's highest score, the number of games played, and the date they joined the platform.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3.3. The Heart of the Ecosystem: The Social Hub</h4>
            <p>Cipher's social features make it a living, breathing community. Our real-time chat system is the beating heart of the ecosystem:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strategy and Socializing:</strong> The global chat room is a hub where players from all over the world can come together to discuss strategies, share tips, and socialize.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Spirit:</strong> Country-specific chat rooms provide a foundation for national teams to form. Players can communicate in their native language, motivate each other, and develop common strategies to carry their country to the top of the leaderboard.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h3>4. Tokenomics ($CIPHER)</h3>
            <p>The $CIPHER token is the utility token at the heart of the Cipher ecosystem.</p>
            <h4>4.1. Token Utility</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access to Exclusive Content:</strong> Access to token-holder-only tournaments, premium game modes, or cosmetic items (e.g., special profile frames, game board skins).</li>
                <li><strong>Staking:</strong> Players can stake their $CIPHER tokens to receive a share of platform revenues or earn special rewards.</li>
                <li><strong>Governance:</strong> Through a future DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), token holders will have voting rights in decisions about the future development of the project.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4.2. Token Distribution</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> To be determined.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Sale / Liquidity (90%):</strong> Reserved to ensure project liquidity and a fair distribution to the community.</li>
                <li><strong>Team (10%):</strong> Reserved for the project's founding team, subject to a vesting schedule to ensure long-term commitment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4.3. Vesting Schedule</h4>
            <p>Team tokens are subject to a vesting schedule to demonstrate commitment to the long-term success of the project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cliff:</strong> 12 months. No tokens are released during this period.</li>
                <li><strong>Total Vesting Period:</strong> 36 months. After the 12-month cliff, tokens are released in equal monthly installments over the following 24 months.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h3>5. Technical Architecture</h3>
            <p>Cipher is built on a scalable, secure, and robust infrastructure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js and Express.js provide a flexible and fast API.</li>
                <li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL guarantees data integrity and complex query capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time:</strong> Socket.IO enables low-latency communication for chat and future live game features.</li>
                <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Vanilla JavaScript offers a fast and optimized user experience with minimal dependency on external libraries.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Industry-standard security measures are implemented, such as <code>bcryptjs</code> for password security, <code>helmet</code> for common vulnerabilities, and <code>DOMPurify</code> to prevent XSS attacks.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
